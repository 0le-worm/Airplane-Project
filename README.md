# Aviation Risk Analysis Project
October 6, 2023

## Project Overview
This project analyzes airplane accidents from 2008 to 2022. This notebook showcases data cleaning, imputation, and analysis that generate relevant insights on key risks when purchasing a plane. The attached Tableau Dashboard features visualizations of these findings.

### Business Understanding
The project brief stated that our company is expanding in to new industries to diversify its portfolio, and specifically interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises. We will offer actionable insights on the lowest risk planes for the company to start this new business endeavor.

We began by asking: 
1. What is the budget for initial investment?
2. What variables effect risk the most?
3. How can we mitigate risk while working within a constrained budget? 

### Data Understanding and Analysis
The dataset comes from National Transportation Safety Board and includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2022 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters. 

Crashes can be tracked across qualitatitve data points, such as details about the aircraft (model, make, engine). Quantitative data is also available, notably allowing us to track engine numbers, TimeDates of incidents, and injury counts from the crashes. 

For the purpose of our research, we filtered data to cover airplanes built by the top 10 manufacturers from 2008 onwards. 


- Three visualizations (the same visualizations presented in the slides and notebook)

### Conclusion
In conclusion, we found that recipricating engines are the most dangerous. While single-engine planes can appear dangerous, most of these crashes are tied to reciprocating engines. 

Turbo engines, such as the TurboProp, are much safer. Of all the manufacturers, the safest makes for planes with TurboProp single-engines come from Quest. 

A well-made, TurboProp, single-engine plane is our recommendation for starting a new venture under $5 million.
